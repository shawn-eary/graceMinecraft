# Story Time Resource Pack
Right now there isn't much in here. Story Time replaces Disk#13 in the Minecraft game. Even though I have very little in here. Story Time and all derivatives are still Copyright © 2024 by Shawn Eary and Utilars™. You are welcome to play with this pack which is based on open source work, but any commercial use of the Story Time music (or derivatives) must be licensed through Shawn Eary and Utilars™. My terms will be resonable.
